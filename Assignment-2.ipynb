    "If you are familiar with http://stats.nba.com/, some stats pages will directly tell you how the data can be retrieved. For example, the data needed for [Tracking Shots Dashboard](http://stats.nba.com/player/201935/shots-dash/) comes from [this URL](http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerdashptshots?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PerMode=PerGame&Period=0&PlayerID=201935&Season=2017-18&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Playoffs&TeamID=0&VsConference=&VsDivision=). This link can be found under Tools > Developer tools menu (Control-Shift-I) if you are using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Once you open Developer tools, you need to reload the page (for F5). Then, go to `Networks` menu under Developer tools pane. Type into the `Filter` text input box, type `stats/`. This will find (if any) GET URL links that we can use. The URL corresponding to the [Tracking Shots Dashboard](http://stats.nba.com/player/201935/shots-dash/) is [here](http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerdashptshots?DateFrom=&DateTo=&GameSegment=&LastNGames=0&LeagueID=00&Location=&Month=0&OpponentTeamID=0&Outcome=&PerMode=PerGame&Period=0&PlayerID=201935&Season=2017-18&SeasonSegment=&SeasonType=Playoffs&TeamID=0&VsConference=&VsDivision=).

    "His best scoring period looks like it is in overtime, the 5th period. This data may be skewed as the sample size is not very large and so we will only compare the 4th quarter data. The data is similar, but his clutch shooting in GSW seems to be higher. His 4th quarter shooting is 47.1% in OKC and it is 51.6% in GSW. His average in the first 3 quarters on OKC is 51.56%, while his average in GSW is 51.48%. This is remarkably similar. The difference between his 4th quarter shooting and other 3 quarter shooting in OKC is -4.45% while it is .12% higher in GSW. This seems to suggest that Kevin Durant has become more clutch as he moved to the Warriors. This may also be due to many factors including: experience, better teammates, better offensive plays, etc."

    "The first thing that is interesting to note about these 2 plots is that Kevin Durant did not attempt a single Back Court shot on OKC. In an interview he confessed that he never attempted these shots to protect his field goal percentage. It is also interesting to note that the center is his favorite spot on the court. It is pretty interesting to see that his shooting ability on the left side center area has improved by roughly 10%. This is the biggest discrepancy between the two groups of data. Overall it seems that if defenses want to try to stop Durant, they need to stop him from shooting it in the center area and force him to the left/right center areas which are his weakest areas."
